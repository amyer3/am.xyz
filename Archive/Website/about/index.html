<p class="txt">Finance is broken. Capital is allocated inefficiently, using
processes and techniques developed centuries ago and spreadsheets handed down
over the generations. This creates gaps in society;
the people who need access to financial resources the most are often left
without options and are forced into predatory financing. I believe that
technology can fix this.</p>
<p class="txt">I've been passionate about finance my entire life. As a toddler, I watched
the stock exchange open every morning, at 6 years old I made my first stock
pitch (buy EA @ $20), and the second I turned 18, I opened my first brokerage
account. A year later I was offered my first job in banking, where I worked
for over four years saving up enough money to put myself through school.</p>
<p class="txt">I’m motivated to make a real, tangible change for the betterment of society.
I want to use my education and abilities to further this transition from
slow, inefficient financial systems to precise and technology driven ones.
I believe that a faster, smarter and more equal financial system
would benefit society, alleviate poverty, and create economic growth in
regions where it’s needed the most.</p>
